      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently at work we had the need to provision roughly ten iPads in a secure way for a single app usage scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was making good progress using &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator/id434433123?mt=12&#34;&gt;Apple Configurator&lt;/a&gt; (AC) to lock down the iPad.  Then all of the sudden my app wouldn&amp;rsquo;t install on the iPad, despite being very clearly checked on the &lt;em&gt;App&lt;/em&gt; tab of the AC interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was especially troubling because it had worked just the day before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some looking around I found the culprit.  Due to my over zealousness I i had changed a very innocuous feature that prevented &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; apps from being installed, even ones I specified in AC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The offending setting is configured in the &lt;em&gt;Restrictions&lt;/em&gt; payload, under the &lt;em&gt;Media Content&lt;/em&gt; section there is a drown down for App ratings.  A quick and naive reading of that section might think that is just for downloading apps; however it will also block AC from installing them as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.erebusbat.com/img/2015/06-AC-no-apps.png&#34; alt=&#34;AC No Apps&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing the setting back to &lt;em&gt;Allow All Apps&lt;/em&gt; and a quick refresh in AC later and my app appeared as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am OK leaving this setting as it because there is another setting under the &lt;em&gt;Apps&lt;/em&gt; tab that disables the App Store altogether.  When enabled the App Store icon doesn&amp;rsquo;t even appear on the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
